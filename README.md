# Logalyzer for Icecast

If you run an Icecast server and you want to analyze your logs, this is it.

## Installation

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Run `./run.sh`.
3. Now that you're all set up, you can use `node logalyze.js` to add your log files to the database. The web server runs on port 8080.

## Hey there, it's not quite ready.

You can install this and play around with it, but the query editor and the charts aren't quite ready yet.
